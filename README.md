# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Descritpion and Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. 

My task is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Simplified Acceptance Criteria

This project is all about building a CLI (command line) application. Use of SQL and Inquirer are needed.

Final project have the following:
* Main menu
* A way to add and view departments
* A way to add and view roles
* A way to add and view employees
* Structured data
